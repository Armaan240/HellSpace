# HellSpace
Hell Space A savage, purple-drenched space FPS where you tear through corrupted alien code with brutal firepower. Inspired by The Amazing Robopathchers and the intensity of Shooting fight as a cybernetic patcher in zero-G arenas, wielding glitch-busting weapons to cleanse the haunted station Patchspire. Reality is broken. You are the fix.
